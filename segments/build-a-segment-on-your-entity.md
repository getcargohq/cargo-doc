# Build a segment on your entity

_By the end of this section, you should be able to:_

* Grasp the change-driven triggers for workflows
* Use s_egments_ to group users or accounts by certain attributes



**What do you need a segment:** While a unified dataset offers a starting point, it remains fluid with continuous updates, additions, and removals

Segments in Cargo, sit on top of this dynamic entity, tracking these changes and triggers workflows at the right time



## **Creating a Segment:**

### **1. Directly from a Dataset:**&#x20;

When you have a single dataset that already captures the nuances of your segmentation needs, it becomes the most straightforward method to create a segment.

_**How it works:**_

* Navigate to the dataset in question

* Utilize the filter options to narrow down your audience. These filters might include attributes like user age, geographic location, or any other attribute present in your dataset&#x20;

You've now made a segment directly from a dataset.

### **2. From an Entity:**&#x20;

Entities are a step up from datasets. They represent a more refined and possibly amalgamated version of several datasets, that has been sourced, cleaned, and unified from multiple points.

_**How it works**:_

* First, ensure your entity is set up. see more in the Section on Entities&#x20;

* Navigate to this entity and apply the right filters filter options that might now be more extensive than those on a standalone dataset, given the unification of data&#x20;
