# Filtering 101

Creating meaningful segments often involves filtering based on dataset columns and properties.

Hereâ€™s a little glimpse into useful filters:

* **Firmographic**: Attributes of businesses. _e.g., Tech startups founded post-2020 might have filters like Industry: Technology, Type: Startup, and Founded: >2020._
* **Status**: Current phase or condition. _e.g., Tracking tasks? Filters like Status: In-progress or Completed help._
* **Time**: Time-specific attributes. _e.g., For upcoming events, a filter might be Event Date: Next 30 days._
* **Behavioral**: User interactions or actions. _e.g., Segment e-commerce users with over three recent purchases._
* **Psychographic**: Lifestyle or values. _e.g., Segment magazine subscribers keen on sustainable living._
* **Technographic**: Technology used. _e.g., Segment companies by specific CRM software usage._
