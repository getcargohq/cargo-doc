**AI usecase example:**

_You can use AI in a workflow each time you have an input field (so you can use AI in branch, switch, filter and so on) . You can also use it within a workflow as a dedicated action, to write icebreaker and emails, do categorization and classification, or to summarize informations_



Insights summarization: Create actionable sales notes to your sales rep to let them engage meaningful conversation with prospects

Icebreaker: Create personalized hook for each of your prospects based on 1rst & third party data

Personalized email: Write personalized sales emails at scale and push them in a custom attribute in your outreach tool
