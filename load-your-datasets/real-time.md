# Real time webhooks

A lot of the use cases built on Cargo use real-time data collection from their data source of choice to directly trigger workflows

This can be pretty useful where workflow triggers are time-sensitive (e.g. handling an inbound lead on your website) in which case Cargo has a seamless connection possible with that data source (if it supports sending data via webhooks)



**Note:** Webhooks![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-10-02 at 10.36.38.png>) send data directly to workflows, instead of creating a data set.



* **Step 1**: Start a new workflow and choose 'Webhook' as the trigger&#x20;

* **Step 2**: Navigate to the left column inside the workflow and copy the Cargo's URL to communicate with the webhook

* **Step 3**: Paste the URL into your origin tool (e.g. Hubspot forms or Captain data)
* **Step 4**: Send a test run and preview it in Cargo
