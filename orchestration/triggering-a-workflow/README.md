## Deploy to automatically enrol records from your segment



Before deploying, choose the right enrolment conditions so that the workflow triggers for the right kind of records.

#### **Change kinds**

* **Added**: Trigger on records that have been freshly added to the segment
* **Updated:** Trigger on records that have one of their attributes updated&#x20;
* **Removed:** Trigger on records that have been removed from the segment

#### **Run creation rule**

* **Always enroll**: Always triggers on records from the segment even if it has already been treated
* **Enroll once**: Skip records from the segment if it has already been treated
* If is **not currently enrolled:** Skip records if they are currently in the process of being treated by the workflow
