Create leads on Expandi.io campaigns



### How to obtain a Campaign webhook URL

First of all, you need to create a campaign within Expandi by clicking on the Campaigns button in the sidebar menu on Expandi and on the Add Campaign button. If you have created a campaign already, just open it by clicking on the name of it and go to the Integrations tab.
