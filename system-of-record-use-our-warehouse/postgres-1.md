# Copy of Use Cargo's Snowflake instance

To get the full benefits of a data warehouse, without having to manage it yourself, we offer a Snowflake instance as a paid offer.

**Note:** While this instance comes with added benefits, it also incurs added costs. Thus, it's available exclusively on our premium plans.

## Getting Started:

Just like with the Postgres instance, the process is intuitive:

* **Step 1:** Begin at [**signup**](https://app.getcargo.io/)&#x20;
* **Step 2:** Remember to choose **‘I don’t have a data warehouse’**

* **Step 3:** A little wait as we **install** the Snowflake instance tailored for you. \<add visual>

* **Step 4:** Connect your data sources by **adding a data connector**.&#x20;

* **Step 5**: With the data in place, it's time to add intelligence. Set up a **workflow** to automate and manage processes.
