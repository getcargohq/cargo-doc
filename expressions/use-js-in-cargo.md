Most users today are using scripts to build custom REGEX functions, btu you can do pretty much whatever JavaScript permits you using this function. Here's a few examples:

**Check if an email domain is in the free email provider list**: Create a list of likely free email address providers and perform a REGEX to check if theres's match with any of those domain providers

**Check if a contact email is matching with its name**: Compare the property name with the constitution of the email to check if it refers to the same person

**Categorisation**: Classify if a particular job title suggests a leadership position or not, using a REGEX
