# ðŸ¤– Write AI prompts

**Setup:**

_To use AI in Cargo, you need to have an OpenAI API key._

1. Log in to your **OpenAI account**
2. Click on your account and on '[View API keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)'
3. Create your new secret key and **copy it**
4. Back on Cargo, go on settings and **paste your API key in the 'OPEN AI' section**
5. **Save** your settings



## **How to set it up:**

You can use AI in a workflow each time you have an input field (so you can use AI in a variable node a branch node, switch node, filter node and so on).&#x20;

You can then use it for a range of dedicated actions including (but not limited to):

**Insights summarisation**: Create actionable sales notes to your sales rep to let them engage meaningful conversation with prospects

**Icebreaker**: Create personalized hook for each of your prospects based on 1rst & third party data

**Personalised email**: Write personalised sales emails at scale and push them in a custom attribute in your outreach tool

**Categorisation**: Determine in which function the person belongs to based on a job title. This can be done also to categorise job title by seniority or to analyse sentiment of replies.
