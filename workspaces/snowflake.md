# Use Cargo on Snowflake

Cargo reads data from schemas and tables, even if they are spread across multiple databases, and writes them into new schemas and tables.

It's important to note that **Cargo never overwrites existing schemas and tables**. Instead, it creates its own schemas and tables specifically for this purpose.

To achieve all of this, some setup is required to ensure that Cargo has the necessary permissions.

## Create a dedicated DB for Cargo needs

All data managed by Cargo will be stored and transformed in a dedicated database on your Snowflake instance.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE cargo_db;
```

## Create a user for Cargo

In order for Cargo to run commands, it must be authenticated as a Snowflake user with the necessary permissions on the database you just created above.

```sql
-- Create a role for cargo
CREATE ROLE cargo_role;

-- Grant the cargo database you created above to cargo role
GRANT ALL ON DATABASE cargo_db TO ROLE cargo_role;

-- Create a warehouse for cargo
CREATE WAREHOUSE cargo_wh WITH WAREHOUSE_SIZE='XSMALL' WAREHOUSE_TYPE='STANDARD' AUTO_SUSPEND=60 AUTO_RESUME=true;

-- Grant warehouse to cargo role
GRANT USAGE on WAREHOUSE cargo_wh to role cargo_role;

-- Create a user for cargo
CREATE USER cargo_user PASSWORD='abc123' DEFAULT_ROLE=cargo_role DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE=cargo_wh MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD=false;

-- Grant role to user
GRANT ROLE cargo_role TO USER cargo_user;

-- Cargo user may needs to access data outside the 'cargo_db' database.
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <database_name>.<schema_name> TO cargo_user;
```

Cargo user should have access to the following permissions on the `cargo_db`:

* `OWNERSHIP`
* `MODIFY`
* `MONITOR`
* `USAGE`
* `CREATE SCHEMA`

You can use the following command to check the granted priviliges of the database

```sql
SHOW GRANTS ON DATABASE cargo_db
```

## Allowed IP Addresses

If you're using Snowflake's Allowed IPs network policy, you'll need to add the Cargo IP addresses to your list. Please contact aurelien@getcargo.io to have this configured for you.

## Setup completed ðŸŽ‰

You are ready to use Cargo!
