# ⚙ Introduction

✅ What Cargo can do

1. **Read** data from schemas and tables, even if they are spread across multiple databases,
2. **Writes** them into new schemas and tables

❌ What Cargo will never do

1. **Overwrite** existing schemas and tables

(instead it always creates its own schemas and tables when needed)
