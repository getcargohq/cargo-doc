Pressing the above will open a modal like below. Below we go through what it means:

**Entity**: The other entity you want to build a relationship with, in this case it is 'Audiences'

**Kind:** Whether each unique record SalesforceAccounts maps to multiple records in audiences

**Left column:** The id column in your SalesforceAccounts entity that would map to an adjacent column in your Audiences entity. In this case we've chose Salesforce\_account\_id

**Right column:** The id column in the Audiences entity that maps to the id column you chose above for the SalesforceAccounts entity



## Step 2: Build the relationship the other way round (this between the Audiences entity and the SalesforceAccounts entity

Navigate to the Audiences entity, and add a relationship. For the modal that appears, follow the same process as above but inverse your choices as show below
