# ðŸ’  One to many relationship filters

When you have two entities joined together in a relationship inside Cargo using a one-to-many relationship, you have the ability to do a cross-entity filter on the quantifiable columns of the related entity.

Types of relationship filters you can apply inside Cargo:

**Frequency**

The frequency type filter is always available for such a filter across related entities

**Period (only if time column is setup)**

The periodic filters are only available if your entity contains a column with a time value. In this case, you can filter for records that appear x days prior to the current date
